2FYSH stands for 2 Factor (of authentication) You Should Have. It is a new secure &amp; usable authentication scheme utilizing QR code and NFC card.

# To reproduce
First copy the main to your android projects (I did not use version control system, so yeah...) and build it.

Then spin up php server and go to `/2fysh/index.php`
